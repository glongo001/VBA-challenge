# VBA-challenge
I used VBA scripting to analyze stock market data. 

1. First, I created a loop that ouputs each stock's ticker symbol, the yearly change in stock opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of the year, the percentage change in opening price to closing price, and the total stock volume of the stock.

2. I added a summary table that displayed the greatest % increase, the greatest % decrease, and the greatest total volume.

3. I ran my script on all worksheets, each year, at once.
    - This is the ouput for 2018:
